## Acquiring API Keys

It's a fairly simple process to acquire Tuya API keys, and should take less than 5 minutes.

1. [Signup](https://iot.tuya.com/signup) for a new account.  When asked to fill out additional details, see below screenshot for example values.

3. Next, fill out the app details.  You will not have to use this information in the future, so don't worry too much about the values.  `Pkg name` and `Identifier` must be unique.
